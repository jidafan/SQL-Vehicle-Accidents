## Introduction

Every year there are a vast amount of car crashes that happen on the roadways. In this project, we seek to identify basic trends and see if there is a correlation between certain conditions, the frequency of accidents, and their severity.  The dataset that was used for this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/daveianhickey/2000-16-traffic-flow-england-scotland-wales?select=accidents_2012_to_2014.csv), in this project we solely use the accidents csv file from 2012 - 2014.
